# Overview

This is a simple game that I made to demonstrate scripting in Unity3D using C#. Because of the massive size of Unity projects, I have included my assets, including scripts, in this repository. There are scripts for controlling the player, spawning obstacles, and game-over conditions.

Hungry Hare is a game about a rabbit looking for carrots while avoiding obstacles. Jump over haybales, and use them to help reach those tasty carrots. Avoid rabbit flytraps that want to make a meal out of you.

I wanted to write this program to explore game development and scripting in Unity3D, and I hope you enjoy playing it!
